                For most consumers, their home is the biggest financial and
                emotional investment they make. Through a variety of
                innovative products and services, EHome Improvement Center’s
                goal is to help consumers build the home of their dreams. In
                addition, EHIC offers specialized support and services for
                homeowners and contractors with a team of highly competent
                and well-trained sales consultants. The store inventory
                consist of up to 15,000 different kinds of building
                materials, bathroom and plumbing products, tiles, home
                improvement supplies, appliances and lawn and garden

                can’t find it in the store, we can order it for you. EHome
                Improvement Center is located at Sta. Cruz, Laguna, the
                administrative center of the province of Laguna south of
                Manila. Sta. Cruz is considered as the commercial hub of 20
                neighboring municipalities and one of the major food
                producers of the region. Its proximity to Rizal and Quezon
                provinces has put EHIC in a strategic position as it
                straddles the Manila, Batangas, Quezon growth triangle.
                EHome Improvement Center started in November 28, 2005 as a
                DIY and home improvement store with the focus of servicing
                the needs of homeowners, OFW, real estate developers and
                local business establishments.<br /><br />Our sales
                representative/consultant assisted by our pool of in house
